<p>Currently, I'm a full-stack software engineer at <a href="//www.wayfair.com">Wayfair</a>. I recently graduated from Tufts University with a double major in Computer Science and Cognitive and Brain Sciences. I was born and raised near Chicago, IL (and therefore I'm very passionate about deep-dish pizza).</p>
<p>I specialize in web design and development, and I have experience in a variety of languages and technologies including React, PHP, SASS, and Python. I also enjoy problem solving and exploring the intersection of cognition and computers.</p>
<p>I also love the theatre, and I've been involved in stage management, set construction, and producing. I believe good design is essential, whether it's in posters or organizational spreadsheets.</p>
<p>I spend my free time knitting, kayaking, solving crosswords, and drinking hot chocolate no matter the season.</p>
