<h2>Hi, I'm Selena! I'm a software developer, designer, and stage manager based in Boston, MA.</h2>

I recently graduated from Tufts University with a double major in Computer Science and Cognitive and Brain Sciences. I was born and raised near Chicago, IL (and therefore very passionate about deep-dish pizza).

I specialize in web design and development, and I have experience in a variety of languages and technologies including React, Python, and JavaScript. I also enjoy problem solving and exploring the intersection of cognition and computers.

I also love the theatre, and I've been involved in stage management, set construction, and producing. I believe good design is essential, whether it's in posters or organizational spreadsheets.

I spend my free time knitting, kayaking, solving crosswords, and drinking hot chocolate no matter the season.
