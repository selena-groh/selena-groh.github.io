SUMMARY:

    a personal portfolio for Selena Groh, including a resume
    and a biography
        
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
IMPLEMENTATION BENEFITS AND LIMITATIONS:

    HEADER:
    
        Currently, the footer is fixed at the bottom of the page. It might
        be more aesthetically pleasing to have a header rather than a
        footer, as the footer seems slightly out of place and a
        non-fixed header would take up less space when scrolling down
        the page.
    
    INDEX.HTML:
      
        Currently, the home page contains little information besides a
        picture, a few credentials, and the footer. In the future,
        expanding upon this page would be more visually appealing and
        informative.
        
    CONTENT:
        
        The website does not contain much information besides the
        biography and the resume. Future development should explore what
        other features might be applicable to or interesting for an
        online portfolio.
